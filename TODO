- better SQL scripts support (testing, source viewing)

make_update_script_for_model:
- calculated differences between models are actually differences between metas
- columns are not compared?
- even if two "models" are equal, it doesn't yield so

- controlledschema.drop() drops whole migrate table, maybe there are some other repositories bound to it!
